# Changelog

All notable changes to EMILIA Protocol are documented here.

Versioning model: Protocol spec and reference repo share the root version (1.0.x). SDKs (0.1.x) and MCP server (0.2.x) version independently.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-04

### Highlights
- **3,277 tests** across 125 files — 100/100 audit score (all 10 categories at maximum)
- **EP-IX Identity Continuity** — full state machine: pending → under_challenge → frozen_pending_dispute → terminal; freeze/unfreeze/withdraw operations; rate-limit guard (max 5 open challenges); self-contest guard via ownership graph
- **Protocol Hardening v2** — 9 Supabase migrations (065–073) closing all L99/L90/L75 findings: binding FOR UPDATE, policy version pin, DB-clock expiry, tenant isolation, issuer authority TOCTOU
- **Formal verification extended** — 20 TLA+ properties verified by TLC 2.19 (T1–T20); 6 new EP-IX properties specified (T21–T26); `Claims` constant added to model
- **Audit provenance** — `docs/security/AUDIT_METHODOLOGY.md` documents scope, methodology, 10-category rubric, and reproduction steps
- **API Compatibility Policy** — `docs/api/COMPATIBILITY.md` defines `1.x` stability guarantees, breaking-change policy, and support lifecycle

### Security (migrations 065–073)
- **065**: Unique constraint + trigger on `handshake_bindings` closes TOCTOU double-consumption race
- **066**: `policy_version_number INTEGER` column on `handshakes` enables version pinning
- **067**: `withdrawn` and `frozen_pending_dispute` states added to `continuity_claims` CHECK constraint
- **068**: `policy_rollouts` table for auditable policy deployment history
- **069**: `verify_handshake_writes` RPC — `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on binding; returns `already_consumed` signal on race loss
- **070**: `create_handshake_atomic` RPC — `p_policy_version_number` written atomically in same INSERT as handshake row
- **071**: `verify_handshake_writes` RPC — expiry check moved inside FOR UPDATE block using DB `now()` (authoritative clock)
- **072**: `tenant_id UUID` added to `signoff_challenges`, `signoff_attestations`, `handshake_policies`, `policy_versions`
- **073**: `present_handshake_writes` RPC — issuer authority re-checked under `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`; overrides `verified=false` if race detected

### Protocol
- `checkBinding()` — symmetric `nonce_required` guard: binding nonce presence requires caller to supply nonce (closes nonce-omission bypass)
- `verify.js` — `policy_version_pin_mismatch` check added after policy hash check
- `ep-ix.js` — `freezeContinuityOnDispute()`, `unfreezeResolvedContinuity()`, `withdrawContinuityClaim()` operations; `resolveContinuity()` blocks frozen and withdrawn states; `expireContinuityClaims()` excludes frozen
- `scoring-v2.js` — named constants exported: `DAMPENING_THRESHOLD`, `ESTABLISHMENT_EVIDENCE_GATE`, `ESTABLISHMENT_MIN_SUBMITTERS`, `MAX_UNESTABLISHED_AGGREGATE_CONTRIBUTION`, `MAX_SINGLE_SUBMITTER_CONTRIBUTION`
- `dispute-adjudication.js` — sort uses `CONFIDENCE_WEIGHT_INT` integer comparison (eliminates float non-determinism)
- `constants.js` — `CONTINUITY_STATUS` extended with `FROZEN_PENDING_DISPUTE` and `WITHDRAWN`

### Testing
- **3,277 tests** across 125 files (up from 3,251)
- New test files: `protocol-hardening-v2.test.js` (26 tests covering scoring constants, nonce omission, CONTINUITY_STATUS completeness)
- Load test: `load-tests/binding-lock-contention.js` — 3-scenario k6 test for FOR UPDATE contention benchmarking

### Operational
- `docs/security/AUDIT_METHODOLOGY.md` — full audit scope, methodology, 10-category rubric, findings summary, reproduction steps
- `docs/api/COMPATIBILITY.md` — `1.x` stability guarantees and breaking-change policy
- `docs/api/ERRORS.md` — 12 new/clarified error codes including `nonce_required`, `authority_revoked_at_write`, `policy_version_pin_mismatch`
- `docs/operations/OBSERVABILITY.md` — §10–12: new security check rate metrics, FOR UPDATE contention signal, EP-IX monitoring
- `docs/operations/MIGRATION_RUNBOOK_065_073.md` — ordered rollout guide for migrations 065–073 with verify queries and rollback procedures
- `formal/PROOF_STATUS.md` — updated to reflect 26 total TLA+ properties (20 verified, 6 EP-IX specified)

## [0.9.0] — 2026-03-15 (pre-release)

### Core
- Canonical evaluator — single read brain across all trust surfaces
- Canonical writer — single write brain for all trust-changing operations
- Four-factor receipt weighting: submitter × time × graph × provenance
- Effective-evidence dampening with Sybil quality gate
- Trust profile materialization (snapshot on write, freshness on read)
- Anomaly detection (trust velocity)

### Trust Policies
- 8 policies: strict, standard, permissive, discovery + 4 software-specific
- Policy registry API (GET /api/policies)

### Software Trust (EP-SX)
- Pre-action enforcement (experimental): allow/review/deny for software entities
- Host adapters: GitHub Apps, npm packages, MCP servers, Chrome extensions

### Identity Continuity (EP-IX)
- Spec complete (v0.2)
- Runtime skeleton: migration, lib, 7 API routes
- Continuity-aware evaluator: lineage, inherited disputes, whitewashing flags

### Procedural Justice (Layer 3)
- Dispute lifecycle: 10-state formal state machine
- Human appeal (POST /api/disputes/report, no auth required)
- 7 operator roles with explicit permissions
- Evidence visibility tiers: public, redacted, restricted, operator-only
- Abuse detection: repeated reports, brigading, retaliatory filing, flooding
- Operator audit trail: append-only, before/after state, queryable API
- Reversal propagation: graph_weight → 0, score recomputed

### Evidence Layer
- Receipt pipeline with SHA-256 chain-linked hashing
- Provenance tiers (6 levels, 0.3x–1.0x weight)
- Bilateral attestations (confirm/dispute, 48h window)
- Graph analysis: closed-loop, thin-graph, cluster detection
- DB immutability triggers

### Distribution
- MCP server: 15 tools (initial release; see 1.0.0 for current count)
- Reference SDKs: TypeScript + Python (initial release)
- Conformance suite: 152 automated checks across 7 suites (initial release)
- Cross-language hash verification (JS + Python)
- CI pipeline: tests, build, lint, SDK builds, conformance

### Infrastructure
- Blockchain anchoring: Merkle roots on Base L2
- Deadline enforcement: bilateral 48h, disputes 7d, continuity 30d
- Health endpoint with subsystem checks
